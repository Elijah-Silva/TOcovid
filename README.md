# Toronto COVID Dashboard

The purpose of this application is to share statistics about the coronavirus outbreak using data from the Toronto Public Health Department. The data is aggregated for each neighborhood (140 in total) across Toronto.
The user can observe a number of statistics related to the virus, including, number of cases, number of deaths, new cases and new deaths.
